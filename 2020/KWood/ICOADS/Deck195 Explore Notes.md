# Experiment 1

From ID's

06004 should mostly be in the central Atlantic if the ID is correct.    
06010 should be in the N. Pacific, with lots of obs near the Aleutians and Kuriles.   
07006 should be in the Pacific close to Japan, then Midway, then SW Pacific.   
10009 should be in the Atlantic most of the war, then 1945 in the Pacific (including Aleutians)    
   
I suppose it would be helpful if each year 1942-1945 was a different color.    

And if possible - 

15201
15215
15216

I think these are submarines, and if so these will map to the Aleutian Islands in 1942. (All the data are 1942, so could plot all there on one map, different colors.) 

# Experiment 2

We've been able to sort IDs for most of the combatant ships. DD, DE, and SS are responsible for a little more than half of all obs in Deck 195. 

The next challenge is to figure out the next part, which may be either A-series support ships, or L-series amphibious landing ship (LST, LSD, LCI etc). 

In your spreadsheet attached (tab = Decode) I've sorted the next-most obs productive IDs from this second group.

94

The strategy I'm thinking would be to first plot each prefix (unknown class) by year to see if we can deduce something from the way the ships move about. For example AK and AP ships should move back and forth in convoys between bases and population centers (e.g. East Coast to N. Africa in 1942 and East Coast to UK). L-ships may move to the UK, then back and forth between there and Europe post-June 6 1944. Submarines were obvious since nobody else was going that close to Japan in 1942-43. 

Second, plot the IDs for the example ships (Col G) by year so we can see where they go individually, and from this cross-check the ship history if possible.

32059
41011
43025
51013
59009
61023
89004
94005

Once we can figure out the prefix (class), then we can then look for an example for which we have a logbook image and can use to confirm.
