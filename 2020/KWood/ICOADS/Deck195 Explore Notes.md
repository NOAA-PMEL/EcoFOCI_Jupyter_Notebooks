# Experiment 1

From ID's

06004 should mostly be in the central Atlantic if the ID is correct.    
06010 should be in the N. Pacific, with lots of obs near the Aleutians and Kuriles.   
07006 should be in the Pacific close to Japan, then Midway, then SW Pacific.   
10009 should be in the Atlantic most of the war, then 1945 in the Pacific (including Aleutians)    
   
I suppose it would be helpful if each year 1942-1945 was a different color.    

And if possible - 

15201
15215
15216

I think these are submarines, and if so these will map to the Aleutian Islands in 1942. (All the data are 1942, so could plot all there on one map, different colors.) 

# Experiment 2

We've been able to sort IDs for most of the combatant ships. DD, DE, and SS are responsible for a little more than half of all obs in Deck 195. 

The next challenge is to figure out the next part, which may be either A-series support ships, or L-series amphibious landing ship (LST, LSD, LCI etc). 

In your spreadsheet attached (tab = Decode) I've sorted the next-most obs productive IDs from this second group. 

22
32
41
43
51
59
61
89
94

The strategy I'm thinking would be to first plot each prefix (unknown class) by year to see if we can deduce something from the way the ships move about. For example AK and AP ships should move back and forth in convoys between bases and population centers (e.g. East Coast to N. Africa in 1942 and East Coast to UK). L-ships may move to the UK, then back and forth between there and Europe post-June 6 1944. Submarines were obvious since nobody else was going that close to Japan in 1942-43. 

Second, plot the IDs for the example ships (Col G) by year so we can see where they go individually, and from this cross-check the ship history if possible. 

22021
32059
41011
43025
51013
59009
61023
89004
94005

Once we can figure out the prefix (class), then we can then look for an example for which we have a logbook image and can use to confirm.

## Class IDs from investigation

List of all ID's https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/OnlineLibrary/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm

Prefix | ClassID | Name
01 | BB | Battleship
02 | CA | Heavy Cruiser
06 | CL | Light Cruiser
07 | CV | Aircraft Carrier
10 | CVE | Escort Carrier
12 | DD | Destroyer
14 | DE | Dest. Escort
15 | SS | Submarine
22 | AM | Minesweeper
32 | PG | patrol gunboat
33 | AV | seaplane tender
37 | PY | Patrol Yacht (wx station)
41 | AD | Destroyer Tender
43 | AF | reefer ship
46 | AG | Miscellaneous Auxiliaries | *
51 | AK | cargo ship
52 | AKA | Attack Cargo Ships
59 | AO | fleet oiler
61 | AP | troopship
86 | ARL | Landing craft repair ship
89 | AVP | Seaplane Tender
94 | AS | Submarine Tender
96 | ATF | fleet ocean tugboat
97 | AT | fleet tugboat

33 = AV (seaplane tender)
37 = PY (patrol yacht) - also weather station
86 = ARL (landing craft repair ship)
96 = ATF (fleet ocean tugboat)
97 = AT (fleet tugboat) - also weather station

# Experiment 3 - Battle of Okinawa

Here's another bit of history that may pertinent. It looks like entire Pacific Fleet was massed for the invasion of Okinawa - more than 582 ships are included in the naval order of battle. March-June 1945. It would be interesting to see a map plot of the months March to August of all Deck 195 obs. This might tell us more about the abrupt drop in these months. 

**Wikipedia entry**

For the April 1945 invasion of Okinawa, the Allies assembled the most powerful naval force in history. Since the few remaining capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Combined Fleet had been sunk or otherwise put out of action at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Allies were effectively unopposed in terms of surface vessels; a single mission consisting of the superbattleship Yamato and a few escorts was undertaken, but the task force did not get within 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) of the invasion area.

Since the Japanese air arm had been equally decimated by this point in the war, the lack of trained and experienced pilots led them to deploy the kamikaze extensively in the waters off Okinawa.

 US Navy combat ships:
11 fleet carriers, 6 light carriers, 22 escort carriers, 8 fast battleships, 10 old battleships, 2 large cruisers, 12 heavy cruisers, 13 light cruisers, 4 anti-aircraft light cruisers, 132 destroyers, 45 destroyer escorts

 Amphibious assault vessels:
84 attack transports, 29 attack cargo ships, LCIs, LSMs, LSTs, LSVs, etc.

 Auxiliaries:
52 submarine chasers, 23 fast minesweepers, 69 minesweepers, 11 minelayers, 49 oilers, etc.

 Royal Navy combat ships:
5 fleet carriers, 2 battleships, 7 light cruisers, 14 destroyers

One of the largest Armada's in modern history.

Identify the ships

BB-46 (Maryland), BB-40 (New Mexico), BB-33 (Arkansas) (4/6/1945)

## Identifying Vessels

the Navy maintains the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ship (DANFS - https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs.html) that is mirrored on Wikipedia. There are also lists available from the Navy of ships by ship type and hull number. The Navy histories of each ship are generally detailed enough that I can figure out if I have the correct first guess. If I get several predictions right, I call it known. We have some logbooks we can cross-ref as needed. The problem is I have to first guess the hull type (DD, AK, APA...) of which there are hundreds. What I've seen so far appears to be a hierarchy starting with combatant ships in the low numbers, battleships being 01, and support ships (A-types, etc) are higher.
